This is a Codegniter library to interact with Foursquare.
It uses the popular Foursquare library for PHP developed by Jaisen Mathai
as the core.
It is just a basic Codeigniter library to get started with Foursquare,
but in terms of a Foursquare library - it is pretty good as the base is
from Jaisen Mathai's PHP library.

Codeigniter gurus - kindly forgive me for not sticking to the MVC pattern,
as this just an introductory library.
 And also it can be improved by doing several things such as autoloads,
consumer keys and secrets can be kept on a separate config file and so on.


Codeigniter Details

library:

/system/application/libraries/Foursquare.php
/system/application/libraries/MY_Input.php

MY_Input.php is a hack needed to pass query strings to Codeigniter.
It was developed by Jamie Rumbelow.

controllers:
/system/application/libraries/foursquareController.php

How to use this codeigniter app ?

1. Download the entire repo. It has a full codeigniter setup.
2. The codeigniter setup has its own htaccess for url shortening,
   so that we can use 'http://localhost:8888/FoursquareCodeigniter/controller/method'
   instead of 'http://localhost:8888/FoursquareCodeigniter/index.php/controller/method'
3. Change your config file:
   filename: system/application/config/config.php
   //
   $config['base_url']	= "http://localhost:8888/FoursquareCodeigniter//";
   //
   change the localhost and or port number to ur setting.
4. Go to https://foursquare.com/oauth/
5. Register your consumer as following ( u need to have a foursquare account)
   Application Name: FourSquareCodeigniter
   Application Web Site: http://localhost:8888/FourSquareCodeigniter/foursquareController/index
   Callback URL: http://localhost:8888/FourSquareCodeigniter/foursquareController/callback
6. Copy the consumer key and the consumer secret to the controller.
        There are two places that you have to change inside
        /system/application/controllers/foursquareController.php
        look at the function callback()
               // change keys there
        look at the function index()
                // change keys there
7. You are now setup
8. Fire up ur favorite browser, and go to
   http://localhost:8888/FourSquareCodeigniter/foursquareController/index
You should be able to login through Foursquare.
Foursquare will ask u for permission.
Give it permission and then see the total number of checkins,
and where you have checked in. I think this will always return 20 as the max
as the call is rate limited to 20 results.

Please see foursquare api docs and Jaisen Mathai's
docs for other function calls.

Happy Foursquaring !!!
